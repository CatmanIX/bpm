Projects:
  - Emote search/picker.
    - Figure out where we left off. I don't remember whether or not we had
      something left over to do.

    - Fix it for the new emote-map changes.
      - Consider how nsfw emotes will work with this- will the standard CSS
        catch them? We may need to ensure bpm-nsfw gets applied.
      - Speaking of applying CSS, think about ensuring the core emote code
        doesn't touch it. Either that or make sure it does- might be simpler.

    - Make search an "and" for everything in spaces. Either that or an "or".
      Maybe even an option; I dunno. Search syntax would probably be overkill.

    - Add a way to close it. Since we'll be putting in an "open it up" button,
      it can just go away entirely.

    - Implement a hover/click control to bring it up again.

    - Add drag&drop support to move it around with.

    - Add resizing capability?

    - Prefs for its position/size. Anything else?

    - Integrate.

General TODO:
  - Condense CSS according to matching width/height properties. Algorithm:
    - For every width:
      - For every height:
        - Map (width, height) -> the subset of matching selectors
    - For every subset:
      - If len(subset) > 1 # FIXME: does this guarantee savings?
        - condense()

  - Make all logging consistent and useful.

  - More bzr branches. Consider splitting out emotes. Add everything to a
    repository, with a private branch for the .pem or something. Use branches
    more, for big development projects (like Opera!) so we don't keep stuff
    out of VCS so much.

  - Find a better way to handle data files (including emote-map.js) in Opera.
    "make" and file.read() is awful.

    This will probably come down to external hosting. There will most likely
    be *no* other solution when we get to a userscript variant, anyway.

  - Combine css-support.js and betterponymotes.js. I think this mostly means
    checking that DOMContentLoaded always works the way we need it to.

    Firefox: CSS never, emotes on DOM.
    Chrome: CSS early, emotes on DOM.
    Opera: CSS on DOM, emotes on DOM. # FIXME: is CSS on dom necessary? log(document.documentElement)

  - Move the www files to /bpm/ or something. Rename betterponymotes.update.rdf
    to firefox-updates.rdf for consistency. Basically just move everything a
    level deeper over the course of an update.

  - Rework tooling a bit, mainly update.py and updatehelper.py. Keep a YAML
    file containing a list of subreddits and such, along with any special
    instructions, e.g. "-e".
    - Expand bpextract.py to include more extraction options. Add an ExtractionContext
      (or similar) object to manage global options and things. At a minimum
      I'd like --no-ignore (to search through PONYSCRIPT-IGNORE blocks) and -e
      to extract specific emotes from r/mlplounge.

      Maybe just -e? --no-ignore doesn't do anything useful on its own except
      generate too much noise.
    - Add options to control logging, and omit/include specific warnings. Most
      of them would generally be enabled by default, but we might want to ignore
      certain properties for certain subreddits (we don't need to use them
      globally, then). E.g. require "display: none" by default, but add a option
      like --ignore-prop=display.

Chrome:
  - Make options work more nicely- reloading properly on all pages.
    - localStorage events might work from background.js
  - Try to make options.html reasonably nice looking

Opera:
  - Consider doing settings updating via postMessage- also with Chrome.
    - Requires <style id="bpm-extracss"> so it can be removed...
  - Spend some time fixing up options.html, and copying improvements to Chrome.
    - The code is also a mess.

Update process:
  - $ bin/version.py set -v [...]
  - $ rm build/*.{xpi,crx,oex} # Delete old versions
  - $ make
