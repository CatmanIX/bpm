General TODO:
    - Go through all emotes again with the extractor (preferably first making
      it smarter), but use our shiny new Ignore flag to handle conflicts so we
      no longer omit anything from the emote database.

    - Better CSS update workflow. The process needs to go faster. A little
      interactive tool with "diff", "edit", "resolve" commands could go a long
      way.

    - Better flags support. The CSS and JS maps will be hand-maintained (keep
      them in their own files if we can...)

    - Try to remember what NoMap was supposed to be for (:hover ?)

Chrome:
    - Make options work more nicely- reloading properly on all pages.
        - localStorage events might work from background.js
    - Try to make options.html reasonably nice looking

Performance benchmarking:
    - With, and without, jQuery
    - With, and without, start/ready on each of the main script packs, and the extra CSS files

Update process:
    - Bump version.

    Firefox:
        - Build XPI.
