r/ainbowdash:
    - /fillydash conflicts with r/mlas1, so omitted. It has a lot of aliases,
      though, and this one isn't even publicized.
    - All of the /rd?? aliases are omitted because of conflict with
      r/idliketobeatree. r/dashiemotes has these in /dash?? form.

r/applebloom:
    - /abwant and /rabwant conflict with r/mylittlelivestream, so omitted.
      (r/mll has no aliases for it, and is a slightly older subreddit. I don't
      know what to do.)

r/applejack:
    They have /ja and /aj tables numbered up through the tenth row, but they
    only have emotes to go with five and eight of them, respectively. The extra
    "emotes" (which presently wrap around again) are omitted.

r/dashiemotes:
    - Conflict resolution for r/ainbowdash. Replaces /rd?? with /dash?? and
      redefines /dash* and /wat. Of those, only the /dash?? ones are useful to
      us; the rest are omitted.

r/gallopfrey:
    - /rderpypout is broken (typoed copy/paste)
    - /rdw14
    - /rdw24
    - /rderpypeak
    - /rderpycam
    - /rdw04
    - /dinkypresents is missing
    - /dw01 conflicts with r/daylightemotes, so omitted.

r/idliketobeatree:
    The /st table has emotes numbered through the tenth row, but only three
    exist. The remaining ones are omitted.

r/mlpdrawingschool:
    - Small, irrelevant typo with /twiquery.
    - /pinkiehi is the emote, /pinkiepie is broken.
    - /flutterhug conflicts with r/mlas1; omitted.
    - /happycadance conflicts with r/mylittledaww; omitted.
    - /ppnervous conflicts with r/pinkiepie, so omitted.
    - /abworry conflicts with r/tbpimagedump, so omitted.

r/mylittleandysonic1:
    - We omit a large pile of colored text things.

    - /fillyrd and /fillydash are supposed to be the same

    - /lunafilly is mentioned (probably supposed to be an alias for /fillyluna?)
      but not fully defined. It's omitted, since it breaks convention anyway.

r/mylittleanime:
    - Their emotes use display:inline-block/float:none instead of the usual
      display:block/float:left. Changed to fit in better.
    - /evilbelle and /revilbelle are broken
    - /rchi21, /rchi22, /rchi23, /rchi24, /rchi25 broken from copy&paste fail
    - /woonajuice and /rwoonajuice are duplicates of r/mylittledaww's
    - /sadlyra conflicts with r/mylittleonions

r/mylittlebannertest:
    - Omitted /ban, /alt_text, /tinytxt!, /pinkhover!, and all the //#advice
      crap.
    - /jizz is NSFW. We'll have to remove that eventually.

r/mylittlecelestias:
    - All of their emotes are missing float:left, which is necessary to make
      text go around them nicely. I put it back.

r/mylittlechaos:
    - /horsedick and /horsecock are NSFW.

r/mylittlecirclejerk:
    - A bunch of //#advice* omitted. They may be duplicates of r/mlbannertest.
    - Some weird /dealwithit thing was omitted as it conflicts with r/mlp.
      (Plus, it's weird.)
    - /hugs conflicts with r/mylittledaww; omitted.
    - /shrug conflicts with r/vinylscratch; omitted.

r/mylittledaww:
    - /gummy conflicts with r/mlas1's, so omitted.

r/mylittlefoodmanes:
    - They have a /quillmaster:active that does nothing. What?

r/mylittlemusician:
    - Some more positive image offsets.

r/mylittlenanners:
    - //#bneodestiny omitted.
    - a[href|="/bra04"] broken

r/mylittlepony:
    - /gilda and /manlytears conflict with r/mlas1's, so omitted.

r/mylittleserver:
    - These are barely ponymotes.
    - /swagintosh and /ww20 are conflicts, but also just copies.

r/mylittlesupportgroup:
    - Several colored text things are omitted.
    - They have both /hidash and /hidashie; neither work because of this.
      (Well, /hidashie is Twilight.) Both are omitted for now.
    - /woona is supposed to be ignored, but is partially in the wrong block.
    - There's a bunch of incompatible /filly* aliases marked as "old aliases"
      with BEGIN-PONYSCRIPT-IGNORE.
    - /muffin conflicts with r/mlpds. It's omitted since this isn't the primary
      alias.

r/mylittlewtf:
    - Omitted -blink! tag.
    - /2f is broken in one place (missing "a" bit)
    - a[href|="/ryourface"] is broken
    - a[href|="/ioib"] is broken

r/speedingturtle:
    - /rdj conflicts with r/mlp and has no nice solution. Omitted because I
      generally prefer giving main subs precedence.

r/surprise:
    - /sur26 and /rsur26 are duplicates from r/mlas1, so omitted.

r/tbpimagedump
    - Supposedly there's a "secret" /emyscoot, but it's not fully defined.
    - a[href|="/celetfly"] is broken

    - /smooze and /rsmooze
    - /twifly with r/mlas1animotes

r/vinylscratch:
    - typo breaks both /vsdeal and /rvs01; corrected
    - /rvs01 and /rvs02 don't exist
    - /vshnngg is typoed as /vshnnng, but it doesn't matter
    - LOTS of positive offsets. strange, but ignored.
