General:
    We need an [](/sp):
        a[href="/sp"] {
            display: inline-block;
            padding-right: 100%
            }

r/applejack:
    They have /ja and /aj tables numbered up through the tenth row, but they
    only have emotes to go with five and eight of them, respectively. The extra
    "emotes" (which presently wrap around again) are omitted.

r/darkleemotes:
    There's a big, commented-out block at the bottom for a missing "%%dashie%%"
    set of emotes. Where did these go?

r/idliketobeatree:
    The /st table has emotes numbered through the tenth row, but only three
    exist. The remaining ones are omitted.

r/mylittleandysonic1:
    - We omit a large pile of colored text things.

    - /fillyrd and /fillydash are supposed to be the same

    - /lunafilly is mentioned (probably supposed to be an alias for /fillyluna?)
      but not fully defined. It's omitted, since it breaks convention anyway.

r/mylittlebannertest:
    - Omitted /ban, /alt_text, /tinytxt!, /pinkhover!, and all the //#advice
      crap.
    - /jizz is NSFW. We'll have to remove that eventually.

r/mylittlecelestias:
    - All of their emotes are missing float:left, which is necessary to make
      text go around them nicely. I put it back.

r/mylittlechaos:
    - /horsedick and /horsecock are NSFW.

r/mylittledaww:
    - /gummy conflicts with r/mlas1's, so omitted.

    /*in-line emotes -in and -inp, e.g. texttext[](/b24-in)texttext*/
    a[href^="/"][href*="-in-"], a[href^="/"][href$="-in"], a[href^="/"][href*="-inp-"], a[href^="/"][href$="-inp"] {
        float: none !important;
        display: inline-block !important
        }

    a[href^="/"][href*="-in-"], a[href^="/"][href$="-in"], a[href^="/"][href*="-inp-"], a[href^="/"][href$="-inp"] {
        float: none !important;
        display: inline-block !important
        }

    - /2f is broken in one place (missing "a" bit)
    - a[href|="/ryourface"] is broken
    - a[href|="/ioib"] is broken

- r/surprise:
    - /sur26 and /rsur26 are duplicates from r/mlas1, so omitted.

- r/tbpimagedump
    - Supposedly there's a "secret" /emyscoot, but it's not fully defined.
    - a[href|="/celetfly"] is broken
    - /ajlol conflicts with r/mlas1animotes (same thing, but not animated)

- r/thebestpony:
    - a[href|="/trixboject2"] typo
    - a[href|="/rtrixboject2"] typo
    - /rdcry and /rrdcry conflict with r/mlp, so removed.
    - /smooze and /rsmooze
    - /twifly with r/mlas1animotes
    - /twipoker with r/mlwtf

- r/vinylscratch:
    - typo breaks both /vsdeal and /rvs01; corrected
    - similar breaks /vs07 and /vshappy; also corrected
    - /rvs01 and /rvs02 don't exist
    - /vshnngg is typoed as /vshnnng, but it doesn't matter
    - LOTS of positive offsets. strange, but ignored.
