r/ainbowdash:
    - /fillydash conflicts with r/mlas1, so omitted. It has a lot of aliases,
      though, and this one isn't even publicized.
    - All of the /rd?? aliases are omitted because of conflict with
      r/idliketobeatree. r/dashiemotes has these in /dash?? form.

r/applebloom:
    - /abwant and /rabwant conflict with r/mylittlelivestream, so omitted.
      (r/mll has no aliases for it, and is a slightly older subreddit. I don't
      know what to do.)

r/applejack:
    They have /ja and /aj tables numbered up through the tenth row, but they
    only have emotes to go with five and eight of them, respectively. The extra
    "emotes" (which presently wrap around again) are omitted.

r/dashiemotes:
    - Conflict resolution for r/ainbowdash. Replaces /rd?? with /dash?? and
      redefines /dash* and /wat. Of those, only the /dash?? ones are useful to
      us; the rest are omitted.

r/gallopfrey:
    - /rderpypout is broken (typoed copy/paste)
    - /rdw14
    - /rdw24
    - /rderpypeak
    - /rderpycam
    - /rdw04
    - /dinkypresents is missing
    - /dw01 conflicts with r/daylightemotes, so omitted.

r/idliketobeatree:
    The /st table has emotes numbered through the tenth row, but only three
    exist. The remaining ones are omitted.

r/mlpdrawingschool:
    - Small, irrelevant typo with /twiquery.
    - /pinkiehi is the emote, /pinkiepie is broken.
    - /ppnervous conflicts with r/pinkiepie, so omitted.
    - /abworry conflicts with r/tbpimagedump, so omitted.

r/mylittleanhero23:
    - They have almost nothing but stupid image macros, which I'm omitting
      everywhere for no particular reason (but maybe because I fucking hate
      them). So omitted.

r/mylittleanime:
    - Their emotes use display:inline-block/float:none instead of the usual
      display:block/float:left. Changed to fit in better.
    - /evilbelle and /revilbelle are broken
    - /rchi21, /rchi22, /rchi23, /rchi24, /rchi25 broken from copy&paste fail
    - /woonajuice and /rwoonajuice are duplicates of r/mylittledaww's
    - /sadlyra conflicts with r/mylittleonions

r/mylittlebannertest:
    - Omitted /ban, /alt_text, and all the //#advice crap.

r/mylittlecelestias:
    - All of their emotes are missing float:left, which is necessary to make
      text go around them nicely. I put it back.

r/mylittlechaos:
    - Calling /sbflyrafun NSFW seems like a bit of a stretch, but whatever.

r/mylittlecirclejerk:
    - A bunch of //#advice* omitted. They may be duplicates of r/mlbannertest.
    - Some weird /dealwithit thing was omitted as it conflicts with r/mlp.
      (Plus, it's weird.)
    - /hugs conflicts with r/mylittledaww; omitted.
    - /shrug conflicts with r/vinylscratch; omitted.

r/mylittledaww:
    - /gummy conflicts with r/mlas1's, so omitted.

r/mylittlefoodmanes:
    - They have a /quillmaster:active that does nothing. What?
    - /t18 is defined with a different selector (^= vs |=). Probably doesn't
      make a difference.

r/mylittlefortress:
    - /cheerilee is omitted as a conflict.

r/mylittlelistentothis:
    - /rdsax and /crossfire are copies from r/mlas1; omitted.
    - /pinkiebone and /scootpiano are copies from r/mylittlemusician; omitted.
    - /scratchshrug and /tavishrug, copies from r/mylittlemusician.
    - Also /showstoppers, /mlyra and /colgatebass.
        - /lyragrin is in, as an alias for /mlyra. For some reason its position
          is specified as a percentage.

r/mylittlemusician:
    - Some more positive image offsets.

r/mylittlenanners:
    - //#bneodestiny omitted.
    - a[href|="/bra04"] broken
    - a[href|="/brajbaffle"] broken
    - a[href|="/brlootascoo"] broken
    - a[href|="/brajtherapy"] broken
    - a[href|="/brscootacheer"] broken
    - a[href|="/brabhuh"] broken
    - a[href|="/bra14"] broken
    - a[href|="/brajconfused"] broken
    - a[href|="/brraritydaww"] broken
    - a[href|="/brlily"] broken
    - a[href|="/brthehorror"] broken

r/mylittlepony:
    - /gilda conflicts with r/mlas1, so omitted.

r/mylittleserver:
    - These are barely ponymotes.
    - /swagintosh and /ww20 are conflicts, but also just copies.

r/mylittlesh:
    - Their emotes have all kinds of weird extra properties.
    - /noroi has no background-image.
    - /10x0 and /0x10 are spacer thingies; omitted.
    - Their third spritesheet (including /amnesia) has not a pony to be seen.
      I'm including it for now, but I feel they don't really belong.

r/mylittlesupportgroup:
    - Several colored text things are omitted.
    - They have both /hidash and /hidashie; neither work because of this.
      (Well, /hidashie is Twilight.) Both are omitted for now.
    - /woona is supposed to be ignored, but is partially in the wrong block.
    - There's a bunch of incompatible /filly* aliases marked as "old aliases"
      with BEGIN-PONYSCRIPT-IGNORE.
    - /muffin conflicts with r/mlpds. It's omitted since this isn't the primary
      alias.

r/mylittlewtf:
    - Omitted -blink! flag.
    - a[href|="/ryourface"] is broken
    - a[href|="/ioib"] is broken

r/ponyanarchism:
    - Removed /andy, /books, and /kitty as they are duplicates from r/futemotes.
    - Removed /fut1 through /fut12, also duplicates.
    - Removed /fut13 through /fut15, /futacute, /futaplot, /futapomp (aliases)
      for the same reason.

r/seriouslyluna:
    - /luna! is omitted as it conflicts with r/mlas1. It's very nearly the same
      thing, though. (Unfortunately, I suspect a couple of !important tags will
      cause the differences to bleed through.)

r/spaceclop:
    - /sandwich and /swh7s have float:none instead of float:left; changed.
    - /angel is taken directly from r/mlp, so omitted.

r/speedingturtle:
    - /rdj conflicts with r/mlp and has no nice solution. Omitted because I
      generally prefer giving main subs precedence.
    - /twisitting is broken (was an alias for /phei, which was removed)

r/surprise:
    - /sur26 and /rsur26 are duplicates from r/mlas1, so omitted.

r/tbpimagedump
    - Supposedly there's a "secret" /emyscoot, but it's not fully defined.
    - a[href|="/celetfly"] is broken
    - /ajlol conflicts with r/mlas1animotes (same thing, but not animated)
    - Omitting /reallydumbemotethatisreallystupidandwontbeherelong because it's
      ridiculous (and probably temporary).

r/thebestpony:
    - a[href|="/trixboject2"] typo
    - a[href|="/rtrixboject2"] typo
    - /smooze and /rsmooze removed
    - /twifly conflicts with r/mlas1animotes
    - /twipoker conflicts with r/mlwtf

r/vinylscratch:
    - typo breaks both /vsdeal and /rvs01; corrected
    - /rvs01 and /rvs02 don't exist
    - /vshnngg is typoed as /vshnnng, but it doesn't matter
    - LOTS of positive offsets. strange, but ignored.
