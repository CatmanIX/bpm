    <h2>Better Ponymotes</h2>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Better Ponymotes is a browser addon to display ponymotes across Reddit.
    This means things like <code>[](/c01)</code> will work outside of
    <a href="http://reddit.com/r/mylittlepony">r/mylittlepony</a>, but also that
    ponymotes from other subreddits (such as <code>[](/rose6)</code>) will work
    across the site.

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <h4>Firefox Installation</h4>
    <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.xpi"><code>betterponymotes.xpi</code></a>.

    <p>Firefox should handle the file automatically; if not, drag the file onto Firefox
    and it will install then.

    <h4>Chrome Installation</h4>
    <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.crx"><code>betterponymotes.crx</code></a>.

    <p>Newer versions of Chrome refuse to install extensions except from the
    Chrome Web Store. Since BetterPonymotes is not available in the web store,
    installation requires you to download the file and drag it onto the extensions
    page yourself. Despite this, updates will continue to function as normal.

    <h4>Opera Installation</h4>
    <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.oex"><code>betterponymotes.oex</code></a>.

    <p>Opera should handle the file automatically; if not, drag the file onto the
    Extensions page (Opera -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions).

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p>No matter how you install Better Ponymotes, it will be automatically
    updated just like any other addon. Your browser will periodically check
    this site for new versions, and download them if available. The addon does
    not normally require a restart for updates, however, you may have to refresh
    pages before most new features will work (including new ponymotes).

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
    <h4>Firefox Preferences</h4>
    <p>Go to the Addons Manager (<code>about:addons</code>, Ctrl-Shift-A, or
    Firefox menu -> Add-ons), locate Better Ponymotes in the list, and click the
    "Preferences" button.

    <h4>Chrome Preferences</h4>
    <p>Go to the Extensions page (<code>chrome:extensions</code>, or Wrench menu
    -> Settings, then click Extensions on the left), locate Better Ponymotes in
    the list, and click the "Options" link.

    <h4>Opera Preferences</h4>
    <p>Go to the Extensions page (Opera -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions),
    locate Better Ponymotes in the list, and click the Wrench icon -> Preferences.

    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>BetterPonymotes has two options you can change, controlling whether or not
    certain ponymotes/features are enabled.

    <p>In Firefox, editing these options takes effect immediately. Chrome and
    Opera require a page refresh.

    <h5>Enable NSFW Emotes</h5>
    <p>The <code>Enable NSFW Emotes</code> option does as it says- enables or
    disables display of a handful of questionable ponymotes. These aren't used
    very frequently across Reddit (especially the pony subreddits, which tend
    toward being more SFW), but be warned that some of them are <em>very</em>
    explicit.

    <h5>Enable Extra CSS</h5>
    <p>The <code>Enable Extra CSS</code> option enables the "chaos script", a
    collection of emote flags and modifiers such as <code>-zspin</code>, which
    apply various CSS transformations. You may want to disable this if your
    computer is less capable of handling them, as they're known to bog down
    browsers.

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>Bug reports, feature requests, questions, general feedback or anything
    else should be directed at my
    <a href="http://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Typhos">Reddit inbox</a>.
