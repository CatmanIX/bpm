        <h2>Better Ponymotes Changelog</h2>
        <p>This changelog only lists code changes. Most releases contain whatever
        emote updates were available at the time, and are not mentioned.

        <h5>v28.52 - 2012-09-30</h5>
        <p>Ignores a couple of hard-coded spoiler tags when expanding alt-text.
        <p>Fixed the custom CSS feature not being able to download new files on
        Chrome.
        <p>Fixed the emote blacklist input boxes, again. Pressing enter doesn't
        "submit" the page anymore. Maybe for good this time!
        <p>Custom CSS handles nonexistent subreddits better now- Reddit no longer
        seems to return a 404, so it checks that the Content-Type is text/css.
        <p>Figured out how to make the search input the right size on Chrome.
        <p>Basic UserScript support. Core functionality tested on GreaseMonkey.

        <h5>v27.51 - 2012-09-29</h5>
        <p>Corrected tabbing order with the emotes button- instead of coming
        before save, is now out of the tab order entirely. This sucks, but a
        proper fix requires messing with the save button a little bit.
        <p>Gave up on the sourceinfo bubbles and moved it to alt-text, like
        GrEmB did.
        <p>CSS is a few kb smaller by omitting <code>clear: none</code>.

        <h5>v26.51 - 2012-09-29</h5>
        <p>Fixed emote injection from the search box, which was broken by the
        removal of text in the last release.
        <p>Made the <code>-i</code> (invert) flag work on Firefox and Chrome.
        Chrome uses CSS, Firefox requires a small hack with SVG filters, and
        Opera doesn't seem to support either mechanism.
        <p>Removed global emotes button from frames when on Reddit. Helps with
        certain kinds of addons.

        <h5>v25.50 - 2012-09-29</h5>
        <p>Moved the Chrome version to the webstore.
        <p>Global emotes imply the <code>-in</code> flag, as a formatting fix.
        <p>Added an option to show emote search globally (hidden behind a small
        icon).
        <p>The search box now remembers the last thing you searched on. It
        defaults to <code>sr:mylittlepony</code> as a convenience, so it's not
        blank when you open it.
        <p>Removed the emote name from the search results, so it's easier to
        see the emote. (It's in the title text anyway, so not missing.)
        <p>Hovering over an emote now shows source information in a small pop-up
        box.

        <h5>v24.48 - 2012-09-24</h5>
        <p>Continued cleanup by fixing up options.js.
        <p>Fixed another problem with RES's new "feature". BPM ignored the user
        tag link, but not the votes display as I had not seen it used yet.
        <p>Custom CSS download code now spaces out its requests to Reddit, in
        accordance with their rules.

        <h5>v24.46 - 2012-09-20</h5>
        <p>Massive cleanup effort began- main script essentially rewritten as
        far as diffs go. Script concern areas split apart a bit, and a few
        long-standing messes fixed.
        <p>Firefox now uses the postMessage API instead of self.port, for
        consistency.
        <p>Fixed emote converter and alt-text code running on links more than
        once when they were added to the page with "load more comments".
        <p>Made writing prefs from the frontend script (specifically the emote
        window positioning) not blow away prefs written from other sources-
        particularly, the options page. Also may have improved lag.

        <h5>v22.45 - 2012-09-18</h5>
        <p>Made combiners turn off better- if you had r/mylittlecombiners
        disabled, but NSFW on, they would still move emotes around as if they
        were on. This has been mostly fixed (they still still react to
        pinkiepies).
        <p>Reworked preferences code a bit. Chrome/Opera now redirect writes
        from options.html through background.js. Some common code was pulled
        out. This enables backends to respond to prefs changes on all browsers.
        <p>Fixed an overflow problem in the emote list widgets- with a large
        number of emotes, the boxes generated for them would fall out of the
        &lt;div&gt;.
        <p>Added a custom CSS feature- BPM will apply the raw CSS from the
        specified subreddits. The parser used strips out most non-emote stuff.
        CSS is updated once a week, or when forced. This feature is somewhat
        fragile at the moment, and should be used carefully.

        <h5>v21.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added emote whitelist. Emotes listed here will override all forms of
        blacklisting.

        <h5>v20.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added max emote size option. Blocks all emotes larger than this.
        <p>Made disabled emotes work better on their native subs (though use of
        !important tags will override us in turn, so this isn't perfect).
        <p>Emote blacklist added. Override specific emotes- more fine-grained
        than by subreddit.
        <p>Click blocker added. Makes emotes behave less like links.

        <h5>v19.43 - 2012-09-13</h5>
        <p>(Despite being marked as an emote-only release, this version contains
        core code changes. However, none of this is user-visible.)
        <p>Removed MutationSummary library in favor of using MutationObserver
        directly. Some bugs may have been introduced as a consequence, as MS was
        quite smart about never reporting the same node twice.

        <h5>v19.42 - 2012-09-11</h5>
        <p>Made CSS application work uniformly across browsers, removing the
        need for all the !important tags BGM needed on Firefox. Also fixes
        subreddits overriding built-in emotes, especially r/mlplounge.
