        <h2>Better Ponymotes Changelog</h2>
        <p>This changelog only lists code changes. Most releases contain whatever
        emote updates were available at the time, and are not mentioned.

        <h5>v21.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added emote whitelist. Emotes listed here will override all forms of
        blacklisting.

        <h5>v20.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added max emote size option. Blocks all emotes larger than this.
        <p>Made disabled emotes work better on their native subs (though use of
        !important tags will override us in turn, so this isn't perfect).
        <p>Emote blacklist added. Override specific emotes- more fine-grained
        than by subreddit.
        <p>Click blocker added. Makes emotes behave less like links.

        <h5>v19.43 - 2012-09-13</h5>
        <p>(Despite being marked as an emote-only release, this version contains
        core code changes. However, none of this is user-visible.)
        <p>Removed MutationSummary library in favor of using MutationObserver
        directly. Some bugs may have been introduced as a consequence, as MS was
        quite smart about never reporting the same node twice.

        <h5>v19.42 - 2012-09-11</h5>
        <p>Made CSS application work uniformly across browsers, removing the
        need for all the !important tags BGM needed on Firefox. Also fixes
        subreddits overriding built-in emotes, especially r/mlplounge.
