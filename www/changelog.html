        <h2>Better Ponymotes Changelog</h2>
        <p>This changelog only lists code changes. Most releases contain whatever
        emote updates were available at the time, and are not mentioned.

        <h5>v24.48</h5>
        <p>Continued cleanup by fixing up options.js.
        <p>Fixed another problem with RES's new "feature". BPM ignored the user
        tag link, but not the votes display as I had not seen it used yet.
        <p>Custom CSS download code now spaces out its requests to Reddit, in
        accordance with their rules.

        <h5>v24.46</h5>
        <p>Massive cleanup effort began- main script essentially rewritten as
        far as diffs go. Script concern areas split apart a bit, and a few
        long-standing messes fixed.
        <p>Firefox now uses the postMessage API instead of self.port, for
        consistency.
        <p>Fixed emote converter and alt-text code running on links more than
        once when they were added to the page with "load more comments".
        <p>Made writing prefs from the frontend script (specifically the emote
        window positioning) not blow away prefs written from other sources-
        particularly, the options page. Also may have improved lag.

        <h5>v22.45 - 2012-09-18</h5>
        <p>Made combiners turn off better- if you had r/mylittlecombiners
        disabled, but NSFW on, they would still move emotes around as if they
        were on. This has been mostly fixed (they still still react to
        pinkiepies).
        <p>Reworked preferences code a bit. Chrome/Opera now redirect writes
        from options.html through background.js. Some common code was pulled
        out. This enables backends to respond to prefs changes on all browsers.
        <p>Fixed an overflow problem in the emote list widgets- with a large
        number of emotes, the boxes generated for them would fall out of the
        &lt;div&gt;.
        <p>Added a custom CSS feature- BPM will apply the raw CSS from the
        specified subreddits. The parser used strips out most non-emote stuff.
        CSS is updated once a week, or when forced. This feature is somewhat
        fragile at the moment, and should be used carefully.

        <h5>v21.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added emote whitelist. Emotes listed here will override all forms of
        blacklisting.

        <h5>v20.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added max emote size option. Blocks all emotes larger than this.
        <p>Made disabled emotes work better on their native subs (though use of
        !important tags will override us in turn, so this isn't perfect).
        <p>Emote blacklist added. Override specific emotes- more fine-grained
        than by subreddit.
        <p>Click blocker added. Makes emotes behave less like links.

        <h5>v19.43 - 2012-09-13</h5>
        <p>(Despite being marked as an emote-only release, this version contains
        core code changes. However, none of this is user-visible.)
        <p>Removed MutationSummary library in favor of using MutationObserver
        directly. Some bugs may have been introduced as a consequence, as MS was
        quite smart about never reporting the same node twice.

        <h5>v19.42 - 2012-09-11</h5>
        <p>Made CSS application work uniformly across browsers, removing the
        need for all the !important tags BGM needed on Firefox. Also fixes
        subreddits overriding built-in emotes, especially r/mlplounge.
