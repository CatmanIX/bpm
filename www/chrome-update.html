        <h2>An Announcement</h2>

        <p>If you're seeing this page, it means you're using BetterPonymotes on
        Chrome.

        <p>BetterPonymotes has recently moved to the Chrome webstore in order
        to make installation easier. Unfortunately, this means that it is
        effectively a different extension now- and I can't upgrade you
        automatically.

        <p>All you need to do to move to the new version is uninstall the
        one you have now, and either go
        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hpanfimfblclppbmjhacfdaglmcnpnnb">
        here</a> to get the new one, or click this button:
        <button onclick="chrome.webstore.install()">Install</button>

        <p>Your preferences will be lost in the move, so make sure you check
        those.

        <p>My gratitude for your continued patience.
