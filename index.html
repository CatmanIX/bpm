    <h2>Better Ponymotes</h2>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Better Ponymotes is a browser addon to display ponymotes across Reddit.
    This means things like <code>[](/c01)</code> will work outside of
    <a href="http://reddit.com/r/mylittlepony">r/mylittlepony</a>, but also that
    ponymotes from other subreddits (such as <code>[](/rose6)</code>) will work
    across the site.

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <h4>Firefox Installation</h4>
    <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.xpi"><code>betterponymotes.xpi</code></a>.
    Firefox should handle the file automatically; if not, drag the file onto Firefox
    and it will install then.

    <h4>Chrome Installation</h4>
    <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.crx"><code>betterponymotes.crx</code></a>.

    <p>Be warned that beta versions of Chrome are changing the way extension
    installation works- it will no longer be possible to automatically install
    addons from sites without hosting them through the Chrome Web Store. As I
    may not be doing this, you will have to install it manually, by dragging
    the file onto the extensions page at <code>about:extensions</code>.

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p>No matter how you install BetterPonymotes, it will be automatically
    updated just like any other addon. Your browser will periodically check
    this site for new versions, and download them if available. The addon does
    not normally require a restart for updates, however, you may have to refresh
    pages before most new features will work (including new ponymotes).

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>BetterPonymotes has two options you can change, controlling whether or not
    certain ponymotes/features are enabled.

    <p>In Firefox, these options can be found by clicking Preference in the Addons
    Manager (<code>about:addons</code>). In Chrome, click Options from the
    Extensions (<code>about:extensions</code>) page.

    <p>The <code>Enable NSFW Emotes</code> option does as it says- enables or
    disables display of a handful of questionable ponymotes. These aren't used
    very frequently across Reddit (especially the pony subreddits, which tend
    toward being more SFW), but be warned that some of them are <em>very</em>
    explicit.

    <p>The <code>Enable Extra CSS</code> option enables the "chaos script", a
    collection of emote flags and modifiers such as <code>-zspin</code>, which
    apply various CSS transformations. You may want to disable this if your
    computer is less capable of handling them, as they're known to bog down
    browsers.

    <p>These options normally take effect immediately in Firefox without
    reloading any pages. Chrome requires a refresh.

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
